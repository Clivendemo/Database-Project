# Database-Project
ðŸ“š Library Management System

# Project Description

This project is a **Library Management System** built using **MySQL**, designed to manage books, authors, members, borrowing activities, and shelf organization in a typical library setup. It uses SQL to define tables, constraints, and relationships to reflect real-world library operations.



# Objectives

- Design a normalized relational database.
- Create meaningful relationships (1-1, 1-M, M-M).
- Apply constraints such as PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, and NOT NULL.
- Practice SQL skills in a real-world context.



# How to Run the Project

1. **Install MySQL** if not already installed.
2. **Open MySQL Workbench** or your preferred SQL editor.
3. **Create a new schema/database** (e.g., `library_db`).
4. **Import the SQL script**:

   - Run the `library-management.sql` file to create all tables and relationships.
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SOURCE /path/to/library_management.sql;
     ```

#  Reflections

- Practiced normalization up to 3NF.
- Learned how to implement many-to-many relationships using junction tables.
- Reinforced understanding of data integrity through constraints and foreign keys.
